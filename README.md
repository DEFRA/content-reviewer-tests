#### Service Account Configuration

Overview
This automation framework is configured to run using a service account for authentication and execution. To run tests locally, you must ensure that this service account is properly set up in your environment.

Running Tests Locally
When executing tests from your local machine (via terminal or VS Code), you are required to provide the service account credentials.
Option 1: Set Credentials via Terminal Environment Variables
Before running the tests, set the required environment variables in your terminal session.
Mac / Linux:
Shellexport SERVICE_USERNAME=<service-account-username>export SERVICE_PASSWORD=<service-account-password>Show more lines
Windows (Command Prompt):
BATset SERVICE_USERNAME=<service-account-username>set SERVICE_PASSWORD=<service-account-password>Show more lines
Windows (PowerShell):
PowerShell$env:SERVICE_USERNAME="<service-account-username>"$env:SERVICE_PASSWORD="<service-account-password>"Show more lines

VS Code Debugging
If you are running tests using the VS Code debugger, ensure that the same environment variables are configured in your launch.json:
JSON"env": { "SERVICE_USERNAME": "<service-account-username>", "SERVICE_PASSWORD": "<service-account-password>"}Show more lines

Credentials Access
The service account credentials are not shared publicly for security reasons.
If you do not have the password or are unsure about the correct credentials:

Please raise a request or send an email to the Service/Support Team.
Include your project name and request access to the automation service account credentials.

Important Notes
Do not hardcode credentials in the codebase.
Do not commit credentials to version control.
Always use environment variables for secure handling.
Ensure your session variables are set each time you open a new terminal.

## Local Development

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v20` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running local tests

Start application you are testing on the url specified in `baseUrl` [wdio.local.conf.js](wdio.local.conf.js)

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### Debugging local tests

```bash
npm run test:local:debug
```

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh`

## Running on GitHub

Alternatively you can run the test suite as a GitHub workflow.
Test runs on GitHub are not able to connect to the CDP Test environments. Instead, they run the tests agains a version of the services running in docker.
A docker compose `compose.yml` is included as a starting point, which includes the databases (mongodb, redis) and infrastructure (localstack) pre-setup.

Steps:

1. Edit the compose.yml to include your services.
2. Modify the scripts in docker/scripts to pre-populate the database, if required and create any localstack resources.
3. Test the setup locally with `docker compose up` and `npm run test:github`
4. Set up the workflow trigger in `.github/workflows/journey-tests`.

By default, the provided workflow will run when triggered manually from GitHub or when triggered by another workflow.

If you want to use the repository exclusively for running docker composed based test suites consider displaying the publish.yml workflow.

## BrowserStack

Two wdio configuration files are provided to help run the tests using BrowserStack in both a GitHub workflow (`wdio.github.browserstack.conf.js`) and from the CDP Portal (`wdio.browserstack.conf.js`).
They can be run from npm using the `npm run test:browserstack` (for running via portal) and `npm run test:github:browserstack` (from GitHib runner).
See the CDP Documentation for more details.
